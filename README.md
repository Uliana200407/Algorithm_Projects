## Content detailsðŸ“ƒ
* Labwork_1 - Bubble Sort, Modified Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort - source code and comparisons;
* Labwork_2 - Counting invertions(reading content from file) and give the result - source code works with a help of algorithm: merge sort;
* Labwork_3 - Quick Sort, Quick Sort with medians, Quick Sort with 3 pivots - source code and output of comparisons quantity;
* Labwork_4 - bypassing graph with DFS algorithm with a help of adjacency matrix, outputing traversal order + manual checking;
* Labwork_5 - Heapsort with the aim to estimate the sequence of medians for the given array + manual checking;
* Labwork_6 - HashTable (Hash func FVN1-32),investigate techniques for inserting and searching elements in the hash table, while also considering the possibility of setting the array manually or randomly;
